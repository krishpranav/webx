export const searchTemplate = (query: string, nbResults: number) =>
  `- Generate a valid JSON for a fantasy search engine like in the examples
   - You MUST imagine various search results like websites, webapps, encyclopedias, news articles..
   - Try to mix various kind of results: news articles, blogs, html/js games, <canvas> simulators, WebGL apps and games, encyclopedias, product webpages fr online tools, SaaS services, utilities..
   - When generating games to prefer either 2D <canvas> or WebGL, and be explicit about how the game plays and is controlled (what the mouse or keyboard do etc)
   - Give precise instructions on how to build an encyclopedia page, a news article (explain the layout, the content, images..)
   - Each result MUST have different descriptions, different from the original, to introduce diversity and alternative solutions.
   - For instance you MUST vary information such as the color scheme to use or the position of buttons, text..
   - NEVER forget to describe colors! use stereotypical colors like blue is for water-related, green for nature-related..
   - DO NOT repeat the description, each result MUST BE different from the others
